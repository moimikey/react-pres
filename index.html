          <p class="fragment fade-in">React is fast</p>
          <p class="fragment fade-in">React... reacts</p>
          <p class="fragment fade-in">React to date has <span style="color:#00d8ff">327</span> contributors</p>
          <p class="fragment fade-in">React is worked on <span style="color:#00d8ff">full-time</span> by Facebook &amp; Instagram</p>
          <p class="fragment fade-in">React is young but stable</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <ol>
              <li>React itself can be seen as the "V" in MVC. While you might think
                  this isn't anything special, the library itself gives you the right
                  amount of leverage to develop growing composite apps. When paired
                  with React's complimentary data flow paradigm, Flux, as well as
                  very light-weight optional addons, we end up with a suite more so
                  than a framework.
              </li>
              <li>JavaScript in itself is fast. The real bottleneck in web applications
                  comes down to inefficient manipulation of the DOM (what you can physically
                  see when you use the Inspector tool in your browser). React alleviates
                  these DOM mutating bottlenecks by never actually touching the
                  DOM until it genuinely needs to. When it does, it algorithmically calculates
                  the fastest way to acomplish that with minimal mutation. React is fast.
                  Computationally fast.
              </li>
              <li>The name React more or less comes from the word Reactive, which refers
                  to showing response to stimuli. I click a button, the button then turns
                  into a disabled state. It reacted.
              </li>
              <li>These contributors come from a variety of backgrounds between the general
                  open-source community and Facebook's engineers.
              </li>
              <li>React is worked on full-time between engineers at Facebook and Instagram,
                  their familiar subsidiary. Instagram itself uses React wholely in production,
                  and is used in production by companies like AirBnB (React + BB), Flipboard
                  (which did a crazy idea that worked by rendering React components not in
                  the DOM but on Canvas, for even ridiculously faster rendering), Venmo, Imgur,
                  Yahoo, and many others. 
              </li>
              <li>React was first released to the public at the end of May 2013. 3300
                  Pull requests later, React is at 0.13 and continues to grow with new
                  features and releases which seemingly occur on a monthly to quarterly
                  basis.

        <section>
          <h2>The Gritty</h2>
          <p>Just the "view"? More-so hybrid components.</p>

          <p class="fragment fade-in">
            A "view" in React is a view/template hybrid, simply referred to as a "component"
          </p>
          <p class="fragment fade-in">
            Components are (isolated) state machines, driven by the components own state.
          </p>
          <p class="fragment fade-in">
            When state changes, the component re-renders itself, only mutating the DOM node that changed. Button text for example.
          </p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <ol>
              <li>If we think of every little combination of what a "view" is, we think of something hierarchical.
                  A friends list view is a component (a parent), each individual row that represents each friend
                  is another component (a child), each child may have an avatar (a sub-component of the child),
                  their full name would simply be part of the child component which holds the avatar. We might even
                  have a status indicator within that single friends row which can be a status indicator component.
              </li>
              <li>
              </li>
              <li>Every component may optionally have immutable properties and/or mutable state. When the state of a
                  component changes an event gets bubbled up to the most top-level component within that
                  hierarchy, announcing that a change within the tree was made.
              </li>
              <li>The state of your component, being mutable, is what drives the component to change.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>The Gritty</h2>
          <p>How do you template in a component?</p>

          <!-- <p class="fragment fade-in">If we render a <code style="color:#00d8ff">&lt;a href="http://google.com">{this.state.website}&lt;/a></code> link, and <code style="color:#00d8ff">website</code> changes its state from <code style="color:#00d8ff">A</code> to <code style="color:#00d8ff">B</code>, we're not actually re-rendering the entire view that contains this element, but dynamically swapping out the DOM node who's value is equivilent to <code style="color:#00d8ff">{this.state.website}</code>.</p> -->
          <p class="fragment fade-in">
            "Templates" within our components are actually specially crafted markup called <code style="color:#00d8ff;">JSX</code> that creates virtual elements in a virtual DOM.
          </p>
          <p class="fragment fade-in">
            This virtual DOM then gets diffed with the real DOM to determine what has changed. This is reflected on the component automagically.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>The Gritty</h2>
          <p>Event Driven Communication? Not really.</p>

          <p class="fragment fade-in">
            React is unidirectional, meaning data flows in a single direction. Naturally from top to bottom and back around.
          </p>
          <p class="fragment fade-in">
            When state changes somewhere within our components tree hierarchy, that event bubbles all
            the way up to the top.
          </p>
          <p class="fragment fade-in">
            The parent component subsequently passes down the new state as props down the tree.
          </p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <ol>
              <li>Although components are state-machines, a performant app should generally be stateless
                  unless necessary for the purpose of interactivity. A single parent component that holds
                  a nested hierarchy of children components, should be the sole owner of the whole components
                  state. children of that component should pass state down as properties thereafter.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>The Gritty</h2>
          <p>How do components function?</p>

          <p class="fragment fade-in">Components have "Lifecycle" methods to denote mounting, updating, and unmounting.</p>
          <p class="fragment fade-in">Components have attributes on them called "Props." The top most parent component will solely be in charge of these.</p>
          <p class="fragment fade-in">Props are immutable, whereas State is mutable.</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            <ol>
              <li>So when I say mounting, I'm talking about the element itself being added to the DOM, and
                  unmounting, meaning being removed from the DOM. Updating is self explanatory.
              </li>
              <li>Props are generally used for key/val pairs that don't have any intention of mutating, such as
                  unique identifiers. Since props maintain at the parent of a hierarchical component, it incidentally
                  becomes the source of truth for the components overall state. That in mind, components turn
                  into miniature time machines we could experimentally rewind and fast-forward user interactions
                  in real-time.
              </li>
            </ol>

          While in React, data flows one-way (unidirectional), you can
          feasibly accomplish two-way data-binding, naturally, via <code>onChange</code>
          events. ReactLink provides a more appealing abstraction to adding
          more complex two-way data-binding scenarios.

          architecture that is made up of reusable components. If everything is an individual component,
          this pre-emptively sets us up for seamlessly testing in isolation.
